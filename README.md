# SerenityOS Themes (Unofficial)
This repo is a collection of different themes I created for SerenityOS through a burst of inspiration while having zero theme creation knowledge. It is fine by me if these themes don't see the light day being merged to master, I did try submitting a [PR](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/13188) and was naturally turned down. And so, I [tried](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/13255) again.  :^)
