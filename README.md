# SerenityOS Themes (Unofficial)
This repo is a collection of different themes I created for SerenityOS through a burst of inspiration while having zero theme creation knowledge. It is fine by me if these themes don't see the light day being merged to master, I did try submitting a [PR](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/13188) and was naturally turned down. And so, I [tried](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/13255) again. And [again](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/13410).  :^)

Draft themes are very rudimentary and does not yet conform to SerenityOS technical standards while Stable themes are personally considered to be somewhat compliant, all that remains after PR submission is the elusive approval and merge status.
